## **Maximum sum in Subarray**

Given a array of integers arr we have to find the subarray whose sum is maximum.

Note: You can assume that the answer always exists

#### **Sample Input**
	array = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4];
	

#### **Sample Output**
	6  
	
	from
	
	[4,-1,2,1]

#### **Expected Time Complexity**
__O__(N),where N is the size of the array. 

#### **Expected Space Complexity**
__O__(1), Auxillary space complexity.
